A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

For help getting started with Flutter, view our online
[documentation](https://flutter.io/).

## About the app

This is an simple flutter app made by following an Udemy course, that displays images fetched from a public image placeholder api. It displays one image at a time whenever the user press the "+" button in the app.

This app covers the following concepts from flutter:

- different types of import statement
- Stateful and Stateless Widgets
- Using the Widget's built-in "build" method to contruct UI
- Using setState to cause UI re-render
- Single child and multiple children Widgets inside a Widget
- Basic Widgets such as Container, Padding, MaterialApp, Scaffold, ActionButton, AppBar, and ListView
- Basic styling such as padding, margin and border (through decoration Widget)

## Special thanks to
